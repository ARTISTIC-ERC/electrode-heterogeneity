Electrode Heterogeneity
=========================================================
This repository contains necessary resources for the analysis of heterogeneous 
NMC811 coated electrodes.
There are 2 specific code files :
- __definition.R__ : code developed under R language to perform the 
  Principal Component Analysis and K-Means clustering to define heterogeneity.
- __main.py__ : code developed under Python to train classifiers for predicting the
  impact of manufacturing parameters.

Setup
==========================================================
In the case you need to launch Python codes inside the repository, we ask you to get a virtual environment such as conda. Go to their webpage and download it. All dependencies will be installed on your environment.

You can directly download the repository through the '.zip'. 
Therefore, it is possible to clone the project on your desktop.
Open a Git bash and try :

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcDuquesnoy/electrode-heterogeneity.git
```
